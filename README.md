# My_Projects

1. Arduino/Robot cu expresii:

   - University project
   - In this project, the programm is using 2 ultrasonic sensors, each determining a different distance, and based on those 2 distances an animation is shown on the OLED display(and one of the animations is using a servo motor).

2. Assembly/Proiect(Labirint):

   - University project
   - In this project, you have to move a character throught a labyrinth and reach the end as fast as you can and with the minimum number of moves. You have 3 different levels, each with a different layout and its own highscore.

3. C# & C++/Agentie de turism:

   - Personal project
   - This project was made with a friend as a team project on highschool.
   - In it you can have a look at the hotels around the world and book one or more rooms where you want to spend you holidays, for as many days as you want. You can also book tickets for the plane to go there and come back at the end of it.

4. C++/ProiectPG:

   - University project
   - In this project I created an application that presents a scene using the OpenGL library and is using the Graphics Card to render everything.
   - Here I learned how to: use basic matrix transformation on the 3D space of the computer, create a light source to illuminate the entire scene, view the scene in different methods(vertex, solid and wireframe), map textures to an object, generate shadows based on the position of the light(shadow mapping), use/create shaders for the application.

5. Java:
   - Joc 2D Fighting:
     - Personaj project
     - In this project I learned how to use sounds and how to draw images in a dynamic wasy, so I can create smooth animations for a character that you can move around the scene.
   - MatchPrepare:
     - Personal project
     - This project is an application that is accepting matches for games(like League of Legends and CS:2) by finding the desired button on the screen an pressing it for you. You choose the game you want from the list of available games and press the button "Start" and if you want to change the game, you press the button "Stop" and choose a new game. To make it work, the application must have a picture of the buttons in its specific folder. It also has a button for "Study Mode" where it will terminate any program from a list of programs(it contains games) for 2 hours.
     - In it I learned how to: search an image on the screen, make the mouse do actions without the need of a person, send a termination command throught the code for specific programs.
   - Proiect_ProgramMeme-uri:
     - Personaj project
     - This project is an application that shows a random image on the screen, that is chosen from a folder of pictures, after pressing a button. You can also add images to that folder throught the application by pressing another button and selecting the image you want to add.
     - In it I learned how to read images from a folder and wirite them back where I want to. Here I also learned how to create a Frame and how to show images on it(besides how to show buttons and text).
6. React Native & Java/Mobile Banking:

   - University and Personal project
   - This project was about creating an application that connects to a database, uses CRUD operations on it and provides an interface for easy use(here a mobile application). In this application a client could request an account creation and after the request was approved, they can login to their account. After they are connected, they can see their card, the information about it, how much money they have. They can also see the transaction history, send and receive money throught transfers and see your incomming payments(and also pay for them).
   - Univeristy: The backend part was made in Java, using Springboot and for the database I used MySQL.
   - Personal: The frontend part was made using React Native, something totally new, because I wanted to learn how to connect a backend program with its frontend part and also wanted to learn how to develop a mobile application.

7. VHDL -> Proiect_VGA_im_processing:
   - University project
   - In this project the program reads an image in binary format as an input, applies the Gaussian Filter on it(reduces the noise from the image) and then displays both images(the original one and the modified one) on a VGA connected monitor.
